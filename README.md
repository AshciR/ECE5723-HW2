Homework 2 for ECE 5723 at Worcester Polytechnic Institute: The Design of a Range Counter  
In this assignment you are to design a range counter. The circuit has two input ports: data (8-bit) and reset (1-bit) and one 4-bit output. After a complete synchronous pulse on reset, in the next eight clocks, the circuit receives eight bytes of data on the data port on every rising edge of clock. In the ninth clock, the number of data bytes that fall between 100 and 200 becomes available on the output port of the circuit.
